# **PSAW 2025 Quarto Workshop - Reproducible Science Using Quarto**

**Instructor**: Jon Peake (NWFSC, NMFS Open Science)

**Date**: September 9th, 2025

## **Overview**

Reproducible reports are documents that combine analysis code, outputs (like plots or tables), and narratives to ensure that results can be easily replicated and verified by others. They are commonly used in scientific research, data science, and analytics to maintain transparency and reliability. By incorporating both the code and results into one document (or a collection of documents), anyone can run the same analysis on the same data (or updated data) and obtain the same results. Quarto is a software that combines Markdown language and scientific code to produce high-quality, reproducible reports.

## **Aims and Objectives of this Quarto workshop**

We will discuss the basics of Quarto and how to leverage this tool to take reproducible science to the next level. During this workshop, participants will:

-   Understand what Quarto is and why we use it for reproducible science

-   Learn about Markdown language and how Quarto uses it

-   Integrate dynamic output from code into Quarto documents

-   Explore the different formats that Quarto can produce
