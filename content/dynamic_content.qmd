title: 'Dynamic output in Quarto files: Code, Tables, and Figures'
---

::: {.callout-note title="Learning Objectives"}
1.  Learn about rendering engines and how they work
2.  Understand the structure and format of a code chunk
3.  Learn how to insert dynamic variables into a Quarto document
4.  Create formatted tables and figures using Quarto code chunks
:::

For this session, we will be covering the following topics:

1.  <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/reproducible-publications-quarto/07-code-qmd.html>
2.  <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/reproducible-publications-quarto/08-rendering-code-yaml.html>

## More practice with Code Chunks

The Carpentries tutorials provide a good introduction to code chunks, but you may want some more practice. The [Quarto workshop](https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/quarto-intro/) from [posit::conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference/) slide deck includes some extra examples for integrating dynamic code into Quarto documents: <https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/quarto-intro/materials/1-single-docs/1-welcome-to-quarto/slides.html#/code-cells>

We will walk through some of the features discussed in this slide deck, but feel free to click through on your own for some additional practice.

Code chunk options let you control the output of a code chunk in a YAML-like header at the beginning of the chunk. We will go over a few of these options in this week's sessions, but there are many more options available than what we will cover. Use [this reference guide](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html) for the options available in an R code chunk.
